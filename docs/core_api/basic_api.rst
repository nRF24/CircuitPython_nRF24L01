.. module:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24

.. autoclass:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24
    :no-members:

    This class aims to be compatible with other devices in the nRF24xxx product line that
    implement the Nordic proprietary Enhanced ShockBurst Protocol (and/or the legacy
    ShockBurst Protocol), but officially only supports (through testing) the nRF24L01 and
    nRF24L01+ devices.

    :param ~busio.SPI spi: The object for the SPI bus that the nRF24L01 is connected to.

        .. tip:: This object is meant to be shared amongst other driver classes (like
            adafruit_mcp3xxx.mcp3008 for example) that use the same SPI bus. Otherwise, multiple
            devices on the same SPI bus with different spi objects may produce errors or
            undesirable behavior.
    :param ~digitalio.DigitalInOut csn: The digital output pin that is connected to the nRF24L01's
        CSN (Chip Select Not) pin. This is required.
    :param ~digitalio.DigitalInOut ce_pin: The digital output pin that is connected to the nRF24L01's
        CE (Chip Enable) pin. This is required.
    :param spi_frequency: Specify which SPI frequency (in Hz) to use on the SPI bus. This
        parameter only applies to the instantiated `RF24` object and is made persistent via
        :py:class:`~adafruit_bus_device.SPIDevice`.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.2.0

        - new ``spi_frequency`` parameter
        - removed all keyword arguments in favor of using the provided corresponding
          attributes.

.. automethod:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.open_tx_pipe

    :param address: The virtual address of the receiving nRF24L01. The address
        specified here must match the address set to one of the RX data pipes of the receiving
        nRF24L01. The existing address can be altered by writing a bytearray with a length
        less than 5. The nRF24L01 will use the first `address_length` number of bytes for the
        RX address on the specified data pipe.

    .. note:: There is no option to specify which data pipe to use because the nRF24L01 only
        uses data pipe 0 in TX mode. Additionally, the nRF24L01 uses the same data pipe (pipe
        1) for receiving acknowledgement (ACK) packets in TX mode when the `auto_ack`
        attribute is enabled for data pipe 0. Thus, RX pipe 0 is appropriated with the TX
        address (specified here) when `auto_ack` is enabled for data pipe 0.

.. automethod:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.close_rx_pipe

    :param pipe_number: The data pipe to use for RX transactions. This must be in range
        [0, 5]. Otherwise a `IndexError` exception is thrown.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.2.0
        removed the ``reset`` parameter. Addresses assigned to pipes will persist until
        changed or power to the nRF24L01 is discontinued.

.. automethod:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.open_rx_pipe

    :param pipe_number: The data pipe to use for RX transactions. This must be in range
        [0, 5]. Otherwise a `IndexError` exception is thrown.
    :param address: The virtual address to the receiving nRF24L01. If using a
        ``pipe_number`` greater than 1, then only the MSByte of the address is written, so make
        sure MSByte (first character) is unique among other simultaneously receiving addresses.
        The existing address can be altered by writing a bytearray with a length less than 5.
        The nRF24L01 will use the first `address_length` number of bytes for the RX address on
        the specified data pipe.

    .. note:: The nRF24L01 shares the addresses' last 4 LSBytes on data pipes 2 through
        5. These shared LSBytes are determined by the address set to data pipe 1.

.. autoproperty:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.listen

    Setting this attribute incorporates the proper transitioning to/from RX mode as it involves
    playing with the `power` attribute and the nRF24L01's CE pin. This attribute does not power
    down the nRF24L01, but will power it up if needed; use `power` attribute set to `False`
    to put the nRF24L01 to sleep.

    A valid input value is a `bool` in which:

    - `True` enables RX mode. Additionally, per `Appendix B of the nRF24L01+ Specifications
      Sheet <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/
      nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1091756>`_, puts nRF24L01 in
      power up mode. Notice the CE pin is be held HIGH during RX mode.
    - `False` disables RX mode. As mentioned in above link, this puts nRF24L01's power in
      Standby-I mode (CE pin is LOW meaning low current & no transmissions) which is ideal
      for post-reception work. Disabling RX mode doesn't flush the RX FIFO buffers, so
      remember to flush your 3-level FIFO buffers when appropriate using `flush_tx()` or
      `flush_rx()` (see also the `read()` function).

    .. note:: When `ack` payloads are enabled, this attribute flushes the TX FIFO buffers
        upon exiting RX mode. However, this attribute does not flush the TX FIFO buffers
        when entering RX mode. This is done to better manage the ACK payloads loaded into
        the TX FIFO.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.1.0
        Prior to v2.1.0 this attribute would clear the status flags when entering RX mode. This
        was removed to expedite applications that use manually transmitted acknowledgement
        payloads.

.. automethod:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.any

    :returns:
        - `int` of the size (in bytes) of an available RX payload (if any).
        - ``0`` if there is no payload in the RX FIFO buffer.

.. automethod:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.available

    This function is provided for convenience and is synonymous with the following statement:

    .. code-block:: python

        # let `nrf` be the instantiated RF24 object
        nrf.update() and nrf.pipe is not None

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

.. automethod:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.read

    The `irq_dr` status flag is reset automatically. This function can also be used to fetch
    the last ACK packet's payload if `ack` is enabled.

    :param length: An optional parameter to specify how many bytes to read from the RX
        FIFO buffer. This parameter is not constrained in any way.

        - If this parameter is less than the length of the first available payload in the
          RX FIFO buffer, then the payload will remain in the RX FIFO buffer until the
          entire payload is fetched by this function.
        - If this parameter is greater than the next available payload's length, then
          additional data from other payload(s) in the RX FIFO buffer are returned.

        .. note::
            The nRF24L01 will repeatedly return the last byte fetched from the RX FIFO
            buffer when there is no data to return (even if the RX FIFO is empty). Be
            aware that a payload is only removed from the RX FIFO buffer when the entire
            payload has been fetched by this function. Notice that this function always
            starts reading data from the first byte of the first available payload (if
            any) in the RX FIFO buffer. Remember the RX FIFO buffer can hold up to 3
            payloads at a maximum of 32 bytes each.
    :returns:
        If the ``length`` parameter is not specified, then this function returns a `bytearray`
        of the RX payload data or `None` if there is no payload. This also depends on the
        setting of `dynamic_payloads` & `payload_length` attributes. Consider the following
        two scenarios:

        - If the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is disabled, then the returned bytearray's
          length is equal to the user defined `payload_length` attribute for the data pipe
          that received the payload.
        - If the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is enabled, then the returned bytearray's length
          is equal to the payload's length

        When the ``length`` parameter is specified, this function strictly returns a `bytearray`
        of that length despite the contents of the RX FIFO.

    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
        ``length`` parameter

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0.0
        renamed this method from ``recv()`` to ``read()`` because it isn't doing
        any actual receiving. Rather, it is only reading data from the RX FIFO that
        was already received/validated by the radio.

.. automethod:: circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.send

    :returns:
        - `list` if a list or tuple of payloads was passed as the ``buf`` parameter. Each item
          in the returned list will contain the returned status for each corresponding payload
          in the list/tuple that was passed. The return statuses will be in one of the
          following forms:
        - `False` if transmission fails. Transmission failure can only be detected if
          `auto_ack` is enabled for data pipe 0.
        - `True` if transmission succeeds.
        - `bytearray` or `True` when the `ack` attribute is `True`. Because the payload
          expects a responding custom ACK payload, the response is returned (upon successful
          transmission) as a `bytearray` (or `True` if ACK payload is empty). Returning the
          ACK payload can be bypassed by setting the ``send_only`` parameter as `True`.

    :param buf: The payload to transmit. This bytearray must have a
        length in range [1, 32], otherwise a `ValueError` exception is thrown when the
        `dynamic_payloads` attribute is enabled. This can
        also be a list or tuple of payloads (`bytearray`); in which case, all items in the
        list/tuple are processed for consecutive transmissions.

        - If the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is disabled for data pipe 0 and this
            bytearray's length is less than the `payload_length` attribute for pipe 0,
            then this bytearray is padded with zeros until its length is equal to the
            `payload_length` attribute for pipe 0.
        - If the `dynamic_payloads` attribute is disabled for data pipe 0 and this
            bytearray's length is greater than `payload_length` attribute for pipe 0,
            then this bytearray's length is truncated to equal the `payload_length`
            attribute for pipe 0.
    :param ask_no_ack: Pass this parameter as `True` to tell the nRF24L01 not to wait
        for an acknowledgment from the receiving nRF24L01. This parameter directly controls a
        ``NO_ACK`` flag in the transmission's Packet Control Field (9 bits of information
        about the payload). Therefore, it takes advantage of an nRF24L01 feature specific to
        individual payloads, and its value is not saved anywhere. You do not need to specify
        this for every payload if the `auto_ack` attribute is disabled (for data pipe 0),
        however setting this parameter to `True` will work despite the `auto_ack`
        attribute's setting.

        .. important:: If the `allow_ask_no_ack` attribute is disabled (set to `False`),
            then this parameter will have no affect at all. By default the
            `allow_ask_no_ack` attribute is enabled.
        .. note:: Each transmission is in the form of a packet. This packet contains sections
            of data around and including the payload. `See Chapter 7.3 in the nRF24L01
            Specifications Sheet <https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/
            nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf#G1136318>`_ for more
            details.
    :param force_retry: The number of brute-force attempts to `resend()` a failed
        transmission. Default is 0. This parameter has no affect on transmissions if
        `auto_ack` is disabled or if ``ask_no_ack`` parameter is set to `True`. Each
        re-attempt still takes advantage of
        `Auto-Retry feature <configure.html#auto-retry-feature>`_. During multi-payload
        processing, this parameter is meant to slow down CircuitPython devices just enough
        for the Raspberry Pi to catch up (due to the Raspberry Pi's seemingly slower SPI
        speeds).
    :param send_only: This parameter only applies when the `ack` attribute is set to
        `True`. Pass this parameter as `True` if the RX FIFO is not to be manipulated. Many
        other libraries' behave as though this parameter is `True`
        (e.g. The popular TMRh20 Arduino RF24 library). This parameter defaults to `False`.
        If this parameter is set to `True`, then use `read()` to get the ACK payload
        (if there is any) from the RX FIFO. Remember that the RX FIFO can only hold
        up to 3 payloads at once.

    .. tip:: It is highly recommended that `auto_ack` attribute is enabled
        when sending multiple payloads. Test results with the `auto_ack` attribute
        disabled were rather poor (less than 79% received by a Raspberry Pi). This same
        advice applies to the ``ask_no_ack`` parameter (leave it as `False` for multiple
        payloads).
    .. warning::  The nRF24L01 will block usage of the TX FIFO buffer upon failed
        transmissions. Failed transmission's payloads stay in TX FIFO buffer until the MCU
        calls `flush_tx()` and `clear_status_flags()`. Therefore, this function will discard
        any payloads in the TX FIFO when called, but failed transmissions' payloads will
        remain in the TX FIFO until `send()` or `flush_tx()` is called after failed
        transmissions.
    .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
