About this Library
==================

This is a Circuitpython driver library for the nRF24L01 transceiver.

Originally this code was a Micropython module written by Damien P. George
& Peter Hinch which can still be found `here
<https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/drivers/nrf24l01>`_

The Micropython source has since been rewritten to expose all the nRF24L01's
features and for Circuitpython compatible devices (including linux-based
SoC computers like the Raspberry Pi).
