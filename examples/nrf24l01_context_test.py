# for the RF24 object specified after the word "with".

# NOTE it is not advised to manipulate seperate RF24 objects outside of the
# "with" block; you will encounter bugs about configurations when doing so.
# Be sure to use 1 "with" block per RF24 object when instantiating multiple
# RF24 objects in your program.
# NOTE exiting a "with" block will always power down the nRF24L01
# NOTE upon instantiation, this library closes all RX pipes &
# extracts the TX/RX addresses from the nRF24L01 registers
